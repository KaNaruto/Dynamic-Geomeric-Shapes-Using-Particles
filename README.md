# Dynamic Geometric Shapes Using Particles

This project demonstrates the creation and manipulation of dynamic geometric shapes using particles in Unity. It leverages Unity's Data-Oriented Technology Stack (DOTS) for high performance and efficient handling of a large number of particles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Particle System**: Generate and manage 100,000+ particles using Unity's DOTS and ECS.
- **Geometric Shape Formation**: Particles form various geometric shapes that are dynamic and interactable.
- **Customization**: Control particle attributes such as speed, size, and shape through Unity's inspector.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2020.1 or later
- Unity DOTS packages (Entities, Jobs, Burst)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/KaNaruto/Dynamic-Geomeric-Shapes-Using-Particles.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity.

### Usage

1. Open the `DynamicGeometricShapes` scene.
2. Play the scene to see the particle system in action.
3. Use the inspector to modify particle system parameters such as speed, size, and shape.
